Looking into design databases with the "spacetime" data structure

Primarily thinking about database formalization in hardware design
software, using my perspective of Fv3, GL, and SpaceTime as the tools
of thought.  Looking for a data flow programming that opens onto the
elements of modeling.

Copied my airfoil data code from the ULSF Sagittarius IDA project
(http://code.google.com/p/ulsf-sagittarius) as an example of both data
flow (into GL) and modeling (airfoils).
